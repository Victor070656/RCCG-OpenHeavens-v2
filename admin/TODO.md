- Use `has_role()` for role-based features
- Always use prepared statements for database queries
- Sanitize all user inputs using `sanitize_input()`
- Default admin: username=`admin`, password=`Admin@123`
- **WARNING:** Passwords stored in plain text (no hashing) - for development only!

### File Upload Guidelines:
- Create `uploads/` folder with subfolders:
  - `uploads/events/` - Event images
  - `uploads/sermons/` - Sermon media
  - `uploads/members/` - Member photos
  - `uploads/settings/` - Church logo/favicon
- Set proper permissions: `chmod 755 uploads/`
- Validate file types and sizes
- Generate unique filenames to prevent overwrites

### Frontend Template:
- Use existing admin template from `admin/` folder
- Assets are in `admin/assets/`
- CSS: `assets/css/main.css`
- JS: `assets/js/main.js`
